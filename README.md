# Project Title
Text Classification


## Problem Statement
"Develop a text classification model for sentiment analysis that accurately categorizes text data into two classes: positive and negative reviews. The dataset consists of textual reviews with associated labels, where reviews labeled with 'label2' represent positive reviews and 'label1' represent negative reviews. The objective is to create a robust and reliable NLP model capable of automatically classifying user-generated text reviews, such as product reviews, movie reviews, or book reviews, into these two sentiment classes.



## Goal of this Project
The ultimate goal is to harness the power of NLP and machine learning to enhance the customer experience, improve products and services, and drive business success by leveraging the valuable insights derived from customer sentiment expressed in e-commerce reviews.
